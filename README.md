Household Energy Consumption Analysis: Understanding Patterns with PCA and Clustering

Objective

This project aims to analyze household energy consumption data to identify meaningful patterns and group similar households based on their energy usage behavior. The primary goal is to explore dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and apply clustering methods to segment households into distinct groups.

This project was undertaken as part of an effort to deepen my understanding of data preprocessing, feature reduction, clustering, and the interpretation of energy usage patterns.

Dataset

The analysis is based on the "Household Power Consumption Dataset," which includes:

Features: Global active power, reactive power, voltage, intensity, and sub-metering data for appliances.
Timeframe: Data spans several years, offering a comprehensive view of household energy usage over time.
Methods

1. Data Preprocessing
The raw dataset contained missing values and inconsistent formatting. We handled this by:
Filling missing values with mean values of the respective columns.
Converting date and time columns into a single datetime feature for time-based analysis.
Aggregating data into daily totals to make patterns more interpretable.

3. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA

What is PCA?
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique used to reduce the number of features while retaining the most important information. It simplifies the dataset by transforming the original variables into a set of new variables (principal components) that explain most of the variance in the data.

Why PCA?
Energy consumption data has multiple features that may be correlated. PCA helps:
Identify patterns and relationships between features.
Reduce the complexity of the data while preserving its essential structure.
Key Outcome:
We reduced the dataset to two principal components, which captured most of the variability in the data and provided a 2D space for visualization and clustering.

4. Clustering with K-Means
What is K-Means?
K-Means is a clustering algorithm that groups data into clusters based on similarity. It assigns each data point to the nearest cluster centroid.
Why Clustering?
By segmenting households, we can identify groups with similar energy behaviors:
High-energy users: May require energy-saving initiatives.
Low-energy users: Could serve as models for efficient usage.
Medium-energy users: Represent a balanced profile.
Visualization:
Clusters were visualized in the PCA-reduced 2D space, showing distinct groupings of households.

5. Time-Series Analysis by Cluster
Aggregated daily energy usage was analyzed for each cluster to identify trends and seasonal patterns. This helped uncover:
Differences in consumption across clusters.
Peaks and valleys in usage during specific times of the year.
Results

Clusters Identified:
Three distinct clusters emerged:
Cluster 0: High-energy households with spikes in usage.
Cluster 1: Low-energy households with consistent patterns.
Cluster 2: Moderate-energy households with occasional peaks.
Insights:
High-energy clusters had noticeable peaks during winter months, likely due to heating needs.
Low-energy clusters showed consistent, efficient usage patterns year-round.
Moderate-energy clusters had balanced usage with some seasonal variation.
PCA Contributions:
PCA allowed us to visualize clusters effectively in a 2D space, making it easier to interpret and compare energy usage behaviors.
Learnings

From PCA:
I learned how to reduce data complexity while retaining the most critical information.
Interpreting principal components helped me understand feature relationships, like how Global_active_power correlates with Global_intensity.
From Clustering:
K-Means provided a practical way to segment data and highlight behavioral patterns.
Analyzing the cluster characteristics taught me how to extract actionable insights from raw data.
Visualization:
Graphing clusters in PCA space and plotting daily usage by cluster were powerful ways to communicate findings effectively.
